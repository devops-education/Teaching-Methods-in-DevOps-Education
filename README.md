It's a repository that contains a set of challenge overcome by teaching methods in DevOps. The objective is to help DevOps educators to teach DevOps. Some of theses teaching methods are found in the paper [Overcomming Challenges in DevOps Education through Teaching Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05564.pdf) published at the academic conference **ICSE'23: Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering**.
