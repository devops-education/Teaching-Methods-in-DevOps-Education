_Thanks for your contribution 😊. We'll need to know some information:_

- Share with us a description about how you implemented the teaching method in your DevOps course (How much more detailed, the better for everyone 😉)
- Tell us your experience in DevOps as practitioner, educator, etc...
- Create a short sentence that resume your implemented teaching method (and substitute the title for it)
- Finally, what teaching method existent are you think your teaching experience include 🤔 (_uses the labels available_)? Or if there is not the teaching method, could you recommend something? 🤩 
- Well done, just confirm 🥳😁
